# Simple Scan and DoS APIs

**Description**

Disclaimer: The code in this directory is implemented primarily to perform experiments related to my Master Thesis (l.morgese@student.utwente.nl).

The scripts in this directory implement `services' to launch (different) Scan traffic, and DoS attacks. The services are parametrized on an IP address (or range), and a time-span throughout which the malicious traffic is sent.
